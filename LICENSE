WANT AN EXCEPTION?
If you have a use case that doesn't fit the above, reach out. I might change
my mind. No promises, but I'm not unreasonable.

WHY DOES THIS EXIST?
This software was made by the author, for the author. It is a personal project
that happens to be visible on the internet.

SUPPORT & MAINTENANCE:
There is none. This is not a product. There is no roadmap. There are no
guarantees. If you open an issue, it may be closed while the author is in
the middle of a sandwich. This is not a bug, it is a feature.

RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THIS SOFTWARE DOES OR FAILS TO DO. IF IT DELETES

TL;DR: I made this for me. You can look. That's it. Don't make money from it.
Don't copy it. Don't redistribute it. If you use it anyway and something
breaks, that's a you problem. But hey, if you really want to do something
with it, just ask.
